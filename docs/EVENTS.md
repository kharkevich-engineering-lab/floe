# Events

Context: **the normative WAL-to-webhook event contract**, for anyone changing ref-event shapes, the events
bridge, delivery, or consumer semantics (D32). The golden tests in `crates/floe-server/src/{events,bridge}.rs`
and `tests/events.rs` are its executable form (same discipline as `docs/POLICY.md`).

## Principle

**Events are produced from the WAL by one small service — the bridge (`Role::Events`) — never by the push
path.** It tails each repo's log from a durable per-repo cursor, converts committed entries, POSTs them to your
webhook, advances the cursor. So an event is delivered iff its entry is durable, a crash can't lose one, the lag is
`head_seq − cursor`, and no writer — any serving host, a push broker, the CLI, an import — contains event code:
every writer is covered because the WAL is what is read.

Invariants:

1. Nothing **ever gates a push**: the bridge is another process reading the bucket. A down webhook adds zero
   milliseconds to receive-pack; it adds lag, which is a metric.
2. No no-op events. `old == new` (and `0→0`) emits nothing.
3. No lost events: the cursor advances only after the webhook answered 2xx. Duplicates are possible
   (at-least-once) and carry a deterministic dedup key. Checkpoints preserve their committed segment index
   and a pointer to the preceding checkpoint, so lagging consumers can replay after the manifest trims
   its log window. Missing history fails the catch-up without advancing the cursor.
4. One producer, one instance.

Only `ref` events exist. Not events: push denials and auth failures (metrics + logs), LFS, compaction/checkpoints
(already WAL entries), repo/policy admin (no consumer; the HTTP request log has the principal).

## `ref` event

```json
{
  "action": "update",
  "ref_type": "branch",
  "ref_name": "refs/heads/main",
  "old": "48a0637…",
  "new": "cb38da1…",
  "pusher": "alice@example.com",
  "correlation_id": "d1f916f7-…",
  "repo": "acme/monorepo",
  "_floe": { "schema_version": 1, "seq": "42", "entry_kind": "push", "request_id": "d1f916f7-…" }
}
```

- `action` — `create` / `update` / `delete`. Force is not a wire action (consumers derive it).
- `old` / `new` — **always the full zero OID on create/delete, never `""`** (40 chars sha1, 64 sha256).
- `ref_type` — `branch` (`refs/heads/`), `tag` (`refs/tags/`), `""` otherwise.
- `pusher` — the authenticated principal in the log entry's `meta` (`X-Floe-Principal` on forwarded pushes).
- `correlation_id` / `_floe.request_id` — the user-visible request id: the middleware honours an incoming
  `x-request-id` (else mints one), a front forwards it when it forwards receive-pack, `push_meta` stores it.
- `_floe.seq` — the entry's WAL seq, a JSON **string** (uint64 convention). `entry_kind` — `push` |
  `ref_update`; consumers must not care.
- One event per ref update in the transaction; symbolic (HEAD) retargets and COMPACT / CHECKPOINT / SETTINGS
  entries emit nothing.

**Dedup key (normative): `(repo, _floe.seq, ref_name)`.** **Order: by `seq` per repo.** Nothing else is promised.

## Delivery: the webhook

Each catch-up `POST`s one JSON **array** of events (a batch: everything in `(cursor, head_seq]`) to
`events.webhook_url` with:

```
Content-Type:        application/json
X-Floe-Delivery:   <sha1 hex of the body>                 # the batch's id; safe to dedup on
X-Floe-Signature:  sha256=<hex HMAC-SHA256(body, events.webhook_secret)>   # when a secret is configured
```

Answer 2xx to acknowledge; anything else (or a timeout, 10 s) leaves the cursor where it was and the bridge
retries the same range on the next wake-up. A consumer therefore sees at-least-once delivery of whole batches.
Verify the signature with a constant-time compare before parsing.

**Retention:** keep checkpoint objects and their indexed log segments. Checkpointing folds serving state;
it does not acknowledge webhook deliveries. History written before checkpoints carried segment indexes
cannot be recovered by this reader; it returns an error rather than skipping it. Already advanced cursors
are not rewound automatically.

## The bridge

```
writers (any host, broker, CLI, import) ── manifest.pb CAS ──► bucket ──► notification ──► POST /_events/notify
   (no event code)                                                                               │
                                                                                                 ▼
                 the events host (roles=["events"], one instance):            catch_up(repo): cursor → manifest
                 + sweep every events.sweep_interval (backstop + health check)  → log (cursor, head] → ref events
                                                                               → webhook → CAS cursor → log line
```

`catch_up(repo)` = read `repos/<o>/<r>/events/cursor.json` → fresh manifest → log entries `(cursor, head_seq]` →
`ref` events → webhook → CAS the cursor to `head_seq`. A webhook error leaves the cursor; the next wake-up replays
the same range. A cold cursor starts before the oldest indexed retained entry (including checkpoint history;
pre-seed the cursor to skip history). An import or pre-index checkpoint is the initial history boundary. That initial boundary is persisted before
any delivery, so a failed first attempt retries the same history after a checkpoint or restart. Every published
event is also one structured log line (`event_type="ref"`). Metrics: `events_published_total{sink}`,
`events_bridge_lag_entries{repo}`, `events_bridge_sweep_found_total`; alert on lag growth and catch-up errors.

Wake-ups (both idempotent; they only ever call `catch_up`):
- `POST /_events/notify` with a **bucket notification** naming a finalized `…/manifest.pb` — the commit point
  itself as the notification. Accepted bodies: a GCS Pub/Sub push envelope (`message.attributes.eventType =
  OBJECT_FINALIZE`, `objectId`), an S3 event notification (`Records[].eventName = ObjectCreated:*`,
  `s3.object.key`; MinIO, rustfs and Ceph emit the same shape), or your own glue's `{"key": "repos/o/r/manifest.pb"}`
  / `{"repo": "o/r"}`. Everything else is acked and ignored; a webhook failure answers 503 so the notifier
  redelivers. Authenticated like every route (`require_read`): give the notifier a token.
- The sweep (`events.sweep_interval`, default 5 min): `list` + one conditional manifest GET per repo. Not needed
  for correctness; it is the backstop *and the health check* — a sweep that publishes anything means
  notifications are not flowing (`events_bridge_sweep_found_total`, warn). With no notifier at all, set the
  sweep to the latency you can live with.

```toml
[server]
roles = ["events"]            # or leave roles empty on a one-box install: every role, bridge included
[events]
webhook_url = "https://hooks.example.com/floe"
webhook_secret = "…"          # env: FLOE__EVENTS__WEBHOOK_SECRET
sweep_interval = "5m"
```

## Consumer checklist

1. Verify `X-Floe-Signature` (if you set a secret), then parse the array.
2. Dedup on `(repo, _floe.seq, ref_name)` (or on `X-Floe-Delivery` per batch).
3. Order by `_floe.seq` within a repo; do not assume order across repos.
4. Alert on catch-up errors and growing lag; missing stored history requires operator recovery.

## GitHub facade integrations

The GitHub facade uses this bridge's WAL reader with independent per-installation/per-repo cursors at
`github/events/<generation>.json`; it never shares this native sink's `events/cursor.json`. A failed
GitHub target does not prevent another target (or the native webhook) from advancing. See
`docs/GITHUB.md` §11 for registry subscription selection, retained-history replay and the separate
best-effort PR handler deliveries. Catch-ups serialize per repo/target; sweeps process up to 16 repos
concurrently. Run one events host; additional hosts may produce at-least-once duplicates.
